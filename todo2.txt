x highlight selected message
x go back from thread should select parent message
x side and main windows are not merging then screen size is small
x side window "left arrow" not working
x after going back to main channel from thread scroll is behaving wiredly

- attachment is displaying in all inputs
- no way to create channel
- badges not working correctly
- html parsing failed on production
- save message parsing errros in database
- pins should scroll to latest when opened
- on mobile going back breaks layout of the app

- change state management to recoil?
